# Capacitor 2.0: Mobile apps & PWAs from one codebase

Link to the registered conference: [https://ionicframework.com/resources/webinars/capacitor-2-launch](https://ionicframework.com/resources/webinars/capacitor-2-launch) 

## Ionic Overview

**Ionic Framework**  is an open source  SDK _\(Software Development Kit\)_ for building **cross-platform** \(mobile and desktop\) applications using **web technologies**: HTML, JS, CSS. It comes with a lot of pre-build functionalities and UI Components _\(= high-level building blocks\)_. But it can also be integrated with other UI _\(User Interface\)_ frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue.js

### What is a Hybrid App?

Mobile development represent a lot of use cases for the moment and a Hybrid App is one solution among others. An Hybrid App is a **native application** built with web technology.

The UI provided by ionic is hosted in a **WebView** which is like an embedded browser wrapped in a native app shell. Because it's native, it has **full device access**.

Thus by implementing a Hybrid App the developers mostly use web tehcnologies to build their UI components but they still have acces to the native functionalities of the mobile device. From the point of view of the Operating system \(IOs, Android\) a Hybrid App build with Ionic \(and Capacitor\) is a native application with its own binary and the WebView shell does a lot of background work to translate the code. 

### Cordova: native runtime

Ionic initialy uses Apache Cordova which is a mobile apllication development framework to build applications for mobile devices using web technologies instead of a platform-specific APIs.

Cordova = native runtime tools: "write once, run everywhere".



## Introducing Capacitor 2.0

### what is capacitor

Capacitor is the successor of Cordova for Ionic.

A native runtime for connectiong web apps to native functionality. 

### Capacitor 2.0

## demo: cordova migration

## demo: creating a capacitor plugin for mapbox

## demo: ionic auth connect with azure B2C
