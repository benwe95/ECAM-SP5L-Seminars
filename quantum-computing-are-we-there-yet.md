# Quantum Computing: Are we there yet?

## Short introduction to Quantum Computing \(QC\)

### Classic computing

Classical computers use **binary values** \(0 or 1\) they store in registers \(bit registers\). They use functions on those bits.

On the following figure we can see an example of how a classical computer would solve a search problem. The function takes two bits in entry and return one bit as an output: 1 if the input bits correspond to the solution of the problem.

In this case, F is a very complicated function to implement an costly to execute.

 In the end for cases are possible: 00, 01, 10, 11 and only one will be the answer.

With such a pardagim of computing the time complexity of the search problem would be O\(N\).
