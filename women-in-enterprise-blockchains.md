# Women in enterprise Blockchains

## Introduction

_Alisa DiCaprio_ from [R3](https://www.r3.com/)  = blockchain platform to maintain them 

### 2008 - 2019

Since the begin of the blockchain the technology has kept growing and growing. These progress were made globally accross the industries in the world and there was no hub for innovation.

There were long term deployments and the cloud structures offered some benefits in the technical uses of the blockchain.

### March 11 2020

#### Declining world trade and BCP implementation

Since the begining of the COVI-19 crisis worldwide there was a decline in the world merchandise trade and all the regions were impacted.

However an interesting thing to notice is that accross the world everybody was capable to **go digital in crise situation**.

For example, all banks had to establish **business continuity plans** because nobody could go physically and they couldn't stop their activity.

Thus within a few weeks we saw that the industries were capable of adopting new rules and processes to continue their activity online. The International Chamber of Commerce came with some guide of good practices.

### Blockchain's new path

#### Enterprise implementations

Enterprises **need to go digital** but not with some ramdom technology. It has to be suited with their needs regarding the sercurity, the scalability, the intergration, their main activity,....

The Blockchain is a functional tool in the **digital transformation** to help other technologies to scale up and down. 

## Part 1 - Identity

> _How organizations are balancing the need to secure personal privacy with the requirements to properly identify the parties involved in business transactions._

### _Dr. Amber Ghaddar_, AllianceBlock

Until now there are some problems **of trust** in the financial trades. When making a deal with some organization/people we can't always be sure of their identity.

This is something we saw happening recently during the COVID crisis when countries bought masks to some entreprises that were pure scams. With the emergency of the situation they were in hurry to by these products and they didn't really know who they're speaking to and even if these selling organizations existed for real.

Moreover in this case of trade we are not speaking about two intervenants but many at a time: the **buyer** get in touch with a seller, the **seller** has a supplier, the **supplier** is in touch with an **othaurized distributer** who is in contact with the **factory**. Thus for each intervenant there is a risk of fraud about its identity that you need to validate yourself by making researches. This is can be a tremendous process.

An another approach way simpler would be a "unique" platform where any intervenant in the world could identitfy himself giving some proofs about who he is. Such a system could be done with blockchain.

However this change would cause some disruption in the way things work today. In a sector such as financial trading which is heavily regulated this is something that will be hard to implement.

**Self-Sovereign Identity** is a model for managing digital identity in which a person/organization has a total control on its own data. These could be crossed data from social media, pictures, medical records, ... anything that he chooses to publicly share. That could be stored and secured within a blockchain. Moreover everyone could monetize his own data instead of having big identities \(Facebook, Google, ...\) selling our data to other companies.

### _Genevieve Leveille_, Agriledger

In her speech Mrs Leveille presents a concrete implementation of the Blockchain to track the process of selling mangos from a farmer in Haïti to the consumer. 

In this use case the interest of the blockchain is for the consumer to be able to **identify** the product he is bying. In other words to get every information about this mango from its harvest in Haïti, its worldwide transportation up to the shelving in the store. Every single stage of the process is tracked and kept in the blockchain so that the buyer can access these information by scanning a QR code on the mango.

This is a way for the consumer and any intervenant to get **insurances** about the product they are bying/selling and its quality because now  they can get the confirmation that the mango has passed every validation tests \(temperature, conservation, ...\).

### _Laura De Giovanni_, Tiiqu

Creating a new way to make fair decision making. Bulding trust = journey -&gt; proove to be who you are.

Identity can  be stolen. 

Self-Sovereign Identity.

Every data owner should be able to have access to his data and control it.

## Part 2 - Trade

> _What its like to smoothly transition from traditional centralized sustems to decentralized and ditributed ledgers._

### _Mary Hall_, Oracle

The technology works now it's not just a buzz word.

Fraude, control, transparency,..

There is a need for enterprise to adopt the technology if they don't want to loose some advantage.

Key BC differenciators



### _Emmanuelle Ganne_

_T_he crisis has shown the benefits of decentralization.

Tracking is vital.

### _Sheila Donohue_, Vero



## Part 3 - Sustainability

> _Are there blockchain benefits for developing countries, those that are especially sensitive to sustainable trade practices._

### Krystal Webber, IBM
