## Needs for blockchain

### Issues with current banking systems

1. **Transaction fees**. Even if it is a little commition that seems nothing at the scale of a single paiement, applied to every transactions it represents a huge source of income for the banks. Anyway the participant of the transaction would be happier if they didn't have to pay that fee.
2. **Double spending.** The way that online transactions are made between banks is hard for them to face the problem of double spending. If someone as 500€ on is bank account and tries to pay 400€ to two other person at the same time it's hard to verify the process.
3. **Problems of trust.** The entities responsible for keeping the money of households are the same that can be responsible for financial crisis  and bankruptcy. Moreover in this scenario they can put some restrictions on the way people use their own money \(e.g limit on the withdrawal\).
4. **Problem of centralization**
